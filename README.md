# OCR Accuracy Evaluation for Image-Based Text Extraction

This project is a practical, beginner-friendly guide for users with datasets of scanned images, archival documents, or photos of text who want to extract accurate text using OCR ‚Äî no deep technical setup required.

All workflows run in **Google Colab**, so you don‚Äôt need to install anything locally.

---

##  What You‚Äôll Learn / Do

- Test 4 OCR tools side by side: **Tesseract**, **EasyOCR**, **PaddleOCR**, and **Gemini**
- Improve accuracy with image preprocessing (grayscale, thresholding, shadow removal)
- See which tool performs best for your dataset
- Evaluate OCR output using **Word Error Rate (WER)** and **Character Error Rate (CER)**

## Who This Is For

This repo is ideal for:
-  Humanities & archive researchers with scanned documents
-  Social scientists or students digitising printed material
-  Anyone with a folder of photos who just wants to know:  
  *"Which OCR tool gives me the best results?"*

You don‚Äôt need to install Python, or understand OCR theory ‚Äî everything runs in Google Colab.

## üìå Notes

- Google Drive is used to store image data and outputs
- Preprocessing is optional, but highly recommended for historical or noisy images
- WER/CER comparisons use [`jiwer`](https://github.com/jitsi/jiwer) for reproducibility
