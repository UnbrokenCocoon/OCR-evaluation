# OCR Accuracy Evaluation for Image-Based Text Extraction

This project is a practical, beginner-friendly guide for users with datasets of scanned images, archival documents, or photos of text who want to extract accurate text using OCR — no deep technical setup required.

All workflows run in **Google Colab**, so you don’t need to install anything locally.

---

## ✅ What You’ll Learn / Do

- Test 4 OCR tools side by side: **Tesseract**, **EasyOCR**, **PaddleOCR**, and **Gemini**
- Improve accuracy with image preprocessing (grayscale, thresholding, shadow removal)
- See which tool performs best for your dataset
- Evaluate OCR output using **Word Error Rate (WER)** and **Character Error Rate (CER)**

## 📊 Sample OCR Accuracy Table

| Engine     | WER   | CER   |
|------------|-------|-------|
| EasyOCR    | 0.89  | 0.67  |
| Tesseract  | 0.69  | 0.43  |
| PaddleOCR  | 0.79  | 0.76  |

## 💡 Who This Is For

This repo is ideal for:
- 🏛️ Humanities & archive researchers with scanned documents
- 🧪 Social scientists or students digitising printed material
- 🛠️ Anyone with a folder of photos who just wants to know:  
  *"Which OCR tool gives me the best results?"*

You don’t need to install Python, or understand OCR theory — everything runs in Google Colab.

## 📌 Notes

- Google Drive is used to store image data and outputs
- Preprocessing is optional, but highly recommended for historical or noisy images
- WER/CER comparisons use [`jiwer`](https://github.com/jitsi/jiwer) for reproducibility
